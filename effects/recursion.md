USAGE: recursion [-d dist] [-z zoom ] [-a angle] [- r rot] [-i iter] infile outfile
USAGE: recursion [-h or -help]

-d ..... dist ..... distance to shift on each iteration;
................... float>=0; default=10
-z ..... zoom ..... zoom factor for each iteration;
................... 0<float<=1; default=.8
-a ..... angle .... angular direction to shift on each iteration;
................... -180<=float<180 degree; default=0
-r ..... rot ...... amount of rotation of image on each iteration;
................... -180<=float<180 degrees; default=0
-i ..... iter ..... number of iterations; integer>0; default=8
PURPOSE: To create a recursive affine composite effect in an image.

DESCRIPTION: RECURSION create a recursive affine composite effect in an image. The image is scaled, rotated and shifted by the specified amount on each iteration and then composited over the previous result.

ARGUMENTS:

-d dist ... DIST is distance to shift the image on each iterations. Values are floats >= 0. Typical values are between 10 and 20. The default=10.

-z zoom ... ZOOM is scale factor to apply to the image on each iteration. Values are 0

-a angle ... ANGLE is the direction angle to shift the image on each iteration. It is specified as a counterclockwise rotation -180<=float<=180 degrees. Typical values are between 0 and 90. The default is 0 (along the positive x direction).

-r rot ... ROT is the amount to rotate the image on each iteration. It is specified as a clockwise rotation -180<=float<=180 degrees. Typical values are betwen 0 and 30. The default is 0.

-i iter ... ITER is the number of iterations in the recursion. Typical values are between 5 and 20. Values are integers>0.

CAVEAT: No guarantee that this script will work on all platforms, nor that trapping of inconsistent parameters is complete and foolproof. Use At Your Own Risk.
