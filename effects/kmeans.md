PURPOSE: To apply k-means color reduction to an image.

DESCRIPTION: KMEANS applies k-means color reduction to an image. This is a colorspace clustering or segmentation technique. The user must specify either a number of desired final colors or a set of initial seed colors. If a list of seed colors is not provided, then seed colors will be estimated using IM -colors (color quantization). The algorithm uses the seed colors to group (cluster) each pixel in the image according to the smallest rmse value to each seed color. Then it computes the new mean colors from the clusters. This process iterates until either the convergence value is reached or the maximum number of iterations is reached. The script is limited to fully opaque images.

Arguments:

-n numcolors ... NUMCOLORS is the number of colors to use as seeds. Values are integer>1. The default=5.

-s seedcolors ... SEEDCOLORS is a space delimited list of opaque seed colors. It is used rather than just selecting a given number of colors. Providing a well selected list of colors can make the iteration process quicker. Any valid set of opaque IM colors may be used. This includes rgb, hex or color names. However, there must not be any spaces in the color, especially for rgb color definitions. The default is to just use the desired number of colors.

-m maxiters ... MAXITERS is the maximum number of iterations before stopping. Values are integer>0. The default=40

-c convergence ... CONVERGENCES is the minimum rmse (times 100) between the previous and current set of colors to stop iterating. Values are floats>=0. The default=0.05

-C colorspace ... COLORSPACE in which to do processing; default=sRGB; other colorspaces that do well are YCbCr and LAB.

-v view ... VIEW permits one to list to the terminal or display any of the following options: hexcolors, swatches (and hex colors), progress (and hex colors), all. Hexcolors will list to the terminal the initial seed and final cluster colors in hex notation. Swatches will display the initial and final cluster colors as images to the display. It will also list the hex colors to the terminal. Progress will list each iteration and rmse value to the terminal in addition to the list of initial and final hex colors. All will do all of the above. The default none of the above. Note that hexcolors and swatches will be presented in the working colorspace and not converted to sRGB
