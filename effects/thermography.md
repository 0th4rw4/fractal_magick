USAGE: thermography [-l lowpt] [-h highpt] infile outfile
USAGE: thermography [-help]

-l ... lowpt .... low point value on color table; float; 0<=integer<=100; 
................. default=0
-h ... highpt ... hight point value on color table; float; 0<=integer<=100; 
................. default=100

PURPOSE: To simulate a picture taken with a thermal imaging camera.

DESCRIPTION: THERMOGRAPHY simulates a picture taken with a thermal imaging camera. The low point and high point can be used to shift and scale the color spectrum table.

ARGUMENTS:

-l lowpt ... LOWPT is the low point on the color table (violet end) to use to stretch and/or scale the color spectrum used. Values are integers between 0 and 100. The default=0 (full violet).

-h highpt ... HIGHPT is the high point on the color table (red end) to use to stretch and/or scale the color spectrum used. Values are integers between 0 and 100. The default=100 (full red).

CAVEAT: No guarantee that this script will work on all platforms, nor that trapping of inconsistent parameters is complete and foolproof. Use At Your Own Risk.
